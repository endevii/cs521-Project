# File Share Application

## Description

Using Node, Express, and React, we created an application where anyone can jump in and share files with one another. It is a single room, and you only recieve the files if you are in the room before they are shared.

## Set Up

To run this application you must do a couple of things:

- Make sure that node is installed <[Get node here!](https://nodejs.org/en)>
- Node will come with the latest npm version, if you are having trouble go <[Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)>
- Now open your terminal, while in the `/UIFileShare` directory, do `cd server`.
- Once in the `server` directory, do `npm i` or `npm install`, either works.
- When that finishes, do `npm run start`, and the server should be running.
- Now open another terminal and go to the `client` directory.
- While in there do `npm i` or `npm install` and when that finishes, run `npm run start`.
- A window should open in your browser, if not, just navigate to "http://localhost:3000/"

_All done!_
